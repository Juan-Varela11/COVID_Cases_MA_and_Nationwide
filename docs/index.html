    <b>CDC Weekend Reporting</b><br>
    From what can be observed in the above plots of new daily COVID-19 cases and deaths in Massachusetts, it appears that of late October 2021, the CDC has 
    stopped recording new deaths and cases on the weekend and federal holidays. On those days, they instead report that there are 0 new deaths and cases.

       <b>NOTE (07/09/2022)</b> - Total count of COVID-19 deaths goes from 23,751 on March 13<sup>th</sup>, 2022 down to 19,981 on March 14<sup>th</sup>
       in plot above). Reason for decrease in total number is unknown, reached out to dataset owner Brian Lee.<br>
       <b>RESOLVED (07/15/2022)</b> - Answered received from CDC via email:<br>
        The State of Massachusetts Department of Public Health included a press release on March 10<sup>th</sup> that explains the reduction in 
        the reported number of deaths.<br>
        https://www.mass.gov/news/department-of-public-health-updates-covid-19-death-definition<br><br>

        "CDC reports death data on three other sections of the website: U.S. Cases & Deaths, COVID Data Tracker, and NCHS Provisional Death Counts. 
         The U.S. Cases and Deaths webpages and COVID Data Tracker get their information from the same source (Aggregate Jurisdictional Data); however, 
         NCHS Death Counts are based on death certificates that use information reported by physicians, medical examiners, or coroners in the cause-of-death 
         section of each certificate. Data from each of these pages are considered provisional (not complete and pending verification) and are therefore 
         subject to change. Counts from previous weeks are continually revised as more records are received and processed. Because not all jurisdictions 
         report counts daily, counts may increase at different intervals."
